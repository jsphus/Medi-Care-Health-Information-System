## Key Components

### Authentication System (`classes/Auth.php`)

**Methods:**
- `login($email, $password)` - Authenticate user
- `logout()` - Destroy session
- `isLoggedIn()` - Check login status
- `isSuperAdmin()`, `isStaff()`, `isDoctor()`, `isPatient()` - Role checks
- `getRole()` - Get user role
- `getUserId()`, `getPatientId()`, `getDoctorId()`, `getStaffId()` - Get IDs
- `requireLogin()`, `requireSuperAdmin()`, etc. - Access control

**Session Variables:**
- `user_id`, `user_email`, `is_superadmin`
- `pat_id`, `staff_id`, `doc_id`
- `logged_in` (boolean)

### Database Connection (`config/Database.php`)

**Singleton Pattern:**
- `getInstance()` - Get database connection
- Uses PDO with PostgreSQL
- Connection via Supabase or local PostgreSQL

### Routing System (`includes/router.php`)

**Features:**
- Custom routing based on `routes.php`
- 404 handling
- Base directory detection
- Clean URLs

### UI Components

**Common Patterns:**
- Summary cards with statistics
- Data tables with action buttons (Edit, View, Delete)
- Modals for create/edit forms
- Confirmation modals for delete actions
- Filter sidebars
- Pagination (where applicable)
- Status badges with colors
- Avatar displays with initials

**Action Button Order:**
- Consistent across all tables: **Edit → View → Delete**
- View button uses eye icon (`fa-eye`)
- Edit button uses edit icon (`fa-edit`)
- Delete button uses trash icon (`fa-trash`)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (or Supabase)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or PHP built-in server
- Composer (optional, for dependencies)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Medi-Care-Health-Information-System
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if exists)
   - Or create `.env` file with:
     ```
     DB_HOST=your-db-host
     DB_PORT=5432
     DB_NAME=your-db-name
     DB_USER=your-db-user
     DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
     APP_NAME=Medi-Care Health Information System
     APP_URL=http://localhost
     ```

3. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   # Connect to PostgreSQL
   psql -U your-user -d your-database
   
   # Run schema
   \i schema.sql
   ```

4. **Configure web server**
   - Point document root to project directory
   - Ensure `index.php` is the default file
   - Enable URL rewriting (for clean URLs)

5. **Set permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 755 -R .
   chmod 777 -R public/uploads  # If uploads directory exists
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost` or your configured URL
   - Register a new user or use existing credentials

### Default Data

The schema includes default data:
- **Appointment Statuses**: Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled
- **Payment Statuses**: Paid, Pending, Refunded
- **Payment Methods**: Cash, Debit Card, Credit Card, Mobile Payment, Bank Transfer, Insurance
- **Specializations**: Family Medicine, Cardiology, Neurology, Pediatrics, Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Dermatology, Orthopedics, Gynecology, Psychiatry

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**PHP:**
- Use PSR-12 coding standards
- Use prepared statements for all SQL queries
- Escape output with `htmlspecialchars()`
- Use null coalescing operator (`??`) for default values
- Validate and sanitize all user input

**JavaScript:**
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Use `const` and `let` (avoid `var`)
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Handle errors gracefully

**CSS:**
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM naming convention where applicable
- Use flexbox/grid for layouts
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Security Best Practices

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Always use prepared statements
   - Never concatenate user input into SQL

2. **XSS Prevention**
   - Escape all output with `htmlspecialchars()`
   - Use `json_encode()` for JSON data

3. **Authentication**
   - Use `password_hash()` for passwords
   - Verify with `password_verify()`
   - Implement session timeout

4. **Authorization**
   - Check permissions on every request
   - Use `requireRole()` methods in controllers

5. **Input Validation**
   - Validate on both client and server side
   - Sanitize all user input
   - Use type checking

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Controller**
   - Add to appropriate role folder
   - Include authentication check
   - Handle GET and POST requests
   - Pass data to view

2. **Create View**
   - Follow existing naming convention (`*.view.php`)
   - Include header and footer
   - Use consistent UI components
   - Add action buttons in consistent order

3. **Add Route**
   - Update `includes/routes.php`
   - Follow URL naming convention

4. **Update Navigation**
   - Add menu item to `views/partials/sidebar.php`
   - Use appropriate icon and label

### Database Changes

1. **Schema Updates**
   - Update `schema.sql`
   - Create migration script if needed
   - Update related models/classes

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Add foreign key constraints
   - Use transactions for multi-table operations
   - Handle cascade deletes appropriately

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Authentication works for all roles
- [ ] CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid input
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] All links and buttons function correctly
- [ ] Forms submit and validate properly
- [ ] Modals open and close correctly
- [ ] Charts display data accurately
- [ ] Search and filter functions work

## Common Patterns & Conventions

### Table Views
- Summary cards at the top (3-4 cards with statistics)
- Table with consistent styling
- Action buttons: Edit, View, Delete (in that order)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Filter sidebar (where applicable)
- No checkboxes or bulk actions
- No sort arrows on headers

### Forms
- Use `sanitize()` function for input
- Validate required fields
- Show error messages clearly
- Use modals for create/edit
- Confirmation modals for delete

### Data Display
- Use avatars with initials for users
- Status badges with colors
- Format dates: `date('d M Y', strtotime($date))`
- Format times: `date('g:i A', strtotime($time))`
- Format currency: `₱<?= number_format($amount, 2) ?>`

### Phone Number Format
- Format: `XXXX-XXX-XXXX` (Philippine format)
- Applied on both client and server side
- Stored in database as formatted string

### Date Handling
- Empty date strings converted to `NULL` for database
- Use `DATE()` function in SQL for date comparisons
- Default timezone: `Asia/Manila`
